# Change Log

## 1.1.0
- Added option to show Favorite folder content (top level files). It is the response to the feature request #1.
This feature is not a substitution of the Workspace explorer view, which does by far superior job. It's just a convenience measure for a quick access of the top level folder files.  The feature can be enabled/disabled with `favorites.showFolderFiles` setting.

Note, the feature overall experience is subject to the limitations/defects of the VSCode tree view. These defects are officially reported and being dealt with by the VSCode team:
