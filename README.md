This simple extension allows in adding, removing and managing documents in the globally maintained "Favorites" list. The functionality is self explanatory and includes the following:

* Open document by clicking the item in the _Favorites_ list.
* Add active document to _Favorites_ via the dedicated toolbar button.
* Remove active document from _Favorites_ via the item context menu.
* Refresh (reload) _Favorites_ via the dedicated toolbar button.
* Manage (edit) _Favorites_ list directly in _VSCode_. Once the _Favorites_ list definition is edited and saved the changes are automatically reflected in the _Favorites_ panel.

Note: by default VSCode opens any file clicked from the  _Favorites_ list in the so called "preview mode". Thus the document tabs are reused and every new file is opened in the same tab. If you prefer to open a clicked _Favorites_ document in ane tab then you need to disable document the previewMode is the settings:
1. Use _Command Palette_ to open your settings file ("Preferences: Open User Settings")
2. Add the "workbench.editor.enablePreview" property, and set it's value to _false_.
